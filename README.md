### Introduction

The classification of texts has among all its particularities a great magnitude as well as an imbalance between categories, which distinguishes it and makes it more complicated than that of other types of data, for example the classification of images. In the last decades, automatic document handling has become the largest field of research in the area of science.

The classifier proposed in this writing is based on the tweets for the creation of the corpus that defines a category using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that parse the texts with the help of Keras, but before reaching this point First, the training of a neural network will be carried out, which will help to see how the classification of texts behaves in a more controlled environment..

### Problem Statement (Biden vs. Trump)

The classification of texts, in environments where the volume of data to be classified is so high that it is very expensive for humans to perform this task, requires the use of automatic natural language text classifiers. In a more practical way, let's imagine that the state of mind of people on the Internet could be known, more specifically on Twitter. 

At present scientific and psychological studies have confirmed that social networks have an effect on the mood and mental health of people. But what interests us most at this point, are the moods that are most reflected on Twitter, and even more so, how these moods can affect the election of a president, as is the case in the United States. Can it help or harm a candidate to be elected according to the reflected state of mind? In the development of this project we will train a neural network that can help us not only to perform the classification of texts but also to verify how good or harmful it can be the reflection of emotions on Twitter.
